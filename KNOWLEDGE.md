# Jagports Project Knowledge

## Future Agent Operating Model Investigation

Topic: proactive multi-agent workflow architecture

This topic requires further investigation before implementation.

Potential architecture options:

1. Scheduled polling agents
- Agent watcher process runs continuously on an available host.
- Periodically checks GitHub Issues, Projects, comments, assignments and status changes.
- Evaluation criteria:
  - suitability for Jagports
  - response time
  - operating cost
  - vendor lock-in risk
  - simplicity and ease of deployment
  - technical complexity

2. GitHub Actions event-driven agents
- GitHub events trigger workflows.
- Possible triggers:
  - Issue created or updated
  - Issue assigned
  - Issue comment added
  - Pull Request opened or reviewed
  - Repository file changes
- Evaluation criteria:
  - suitability for Jagports
  - response time
  - operating cost
  - vendor lock-in risk
  - simplicity and ease of deployment
  - technical complexity

3. Coordinator Agent architecture
- A coordinator service routes work between specialised agents.
- Possible responsibilities:
  - detect new work
  - assign agents
  - collect acknowledgements
  - monitor progress
  - detect missing responses
  - maintain information flow
- Evaluation criteria:
  - suitability for Jagports
  - response time
  - operating cost
  - vendor lock-in risk
  - simplicity and ease of deployment
  - technical complexity

Important principle:
Important project information must not exist only in private agent context. Decisions, results and reusable knowledge must be persisted into GitHub Issues, documentation, decision logs or knowledge files.

## AI Tool Capability Transparency

When an AI agent is expected to perform an external action, the agent must distinguish user/account authorization from the execution capabilities actually available in the current session.

If an expected action cannot be completed, record and communicate the verified cause where possible, such as:
- required tool operation unavailable
- insufficient permission
- authentication problem
- unavailable integration
- technical failure

Do not claim that an action was completed without verification. Do not repeatedly retry an unsupported operation without explaining the limitation.

For Jagports, an important operational distinction is:
- GitHub account/repository permissions determine what the account is authorized to do.
- The connected agent/tool interface determines which of those operations the agent can actually invoke in a given session.

When capability availability changes or is uncertain, the agent should state the limitation explicitly and identify the available alternative or required next step.
