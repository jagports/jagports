# Jagports Project Knowledge

## Future Agent Operating Model Investigation

Topic: proactive multi-agent workflow architecture

This topic requires further investigation before implementation.

Potential architecture options:

1. Scheduled polling agents
- Agent watcher process runs continuously on an available host.
- Periodically checks GitHub Issues, Projects, comments, assignments and status changes.
- Evaluation criteria:
  - suitability for Jagports
  - response time
  - operating cost
  - vendor lock-in risk
  - simplicity and ease of deployment
  - technical complexity

2. GitHub Actions event-driven agents
- GitHub events trigger workflows.
- Possible triggers:
  - Issue created or updated
  - Issue assigned
  - Issue comment added
  - Pull Request opened or reviewed
  - Repository file changes
- Evaluation criteria:
  - suitability for Jagports
  - response time
  - operating cost
  - vendor lock-in risk
  - simplicity and ease of deployment
  - technical complexity

3. Coordinator Agent architecture
- A coordinator service routes work between specialised agents.
- Possible responsibilities:
  - detect new work
  - assign agents
  - collect acknowledgements
  - monitor progress
  - detect missing responses
  - maintain information flow
- Evaluation criteria:
  - suitability for Jagports
  - response time
  - operating cost
  - vendor lock-in risk
  - simplicity and ease of deployment
  - technical complexity

Important principle:
Important project information must not exist only in private agent context. Decisions, results and reusable knowledge must be persisted into GitHub Issues, documentation, decision logs or knowledge files.
